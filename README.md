## Problem Statement
Mushroom hunting, or "shrooming", has become increasingly popular as a recreational activity. However, correctly identifying edible mushrooms from poisonous ones can be challenging, even for experienced mushroom hunters. This poses a risk to the safety of mushroom hunters and their companions, as well as the general public if contaminated mushrooms are consumed.

## Problem Motivation

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable machine learning model for mushroom classification that classifies edibile and poisonous mushrooms, enhancing the safety of mushroom hunting activities.

## Files
- data.csv
- index.ipynb (notebook)
- index.html (html ver where you can view as a website)
- presentation.pptx (presentation deck)

## Models used
We would like to find out using which learning algorithm will be the most accurate. We are comparing 3 models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Conclusion/Insights gained
- We concluded the Random Forest is the best classifier to classify mushorooms among the 3 classifiers. Users are recommended the use random forest to help verify whether the mushorooms are edible or poisonous.
- Also, all 3 have attained a score of around 0.97, which we deem is good enough, we do not need to do ensembling.

## What did we learn from this project?
